# Project2_Mathew_Wally

Hello again!

This project is our first attempt at doing a monte-carlo simulation.

The goal is to use the metropolis algorithm to simulate the position of a particle in a 1d box. The project consist of 3 separate classes that are imported and used in the main python file (main.py)

To view the plots, run the main.py file after installing the package using: pip install git+https://github.com/WallyBorden/Project2_Mathew_Wally.git

Thank you
